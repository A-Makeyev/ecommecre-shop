Hey! Lebanese or Israeli? I couldnâ€™t tell
Hhahah
What would you prefer me to be?
Lebanese of course
I wanna see youðŸ˜‚
I have a feeling youâ€™re Israeli. Lebanese men donâ€™t look this good
Theyâ€™re all short fat bald and hairy
Oh always nice to hear I'm hotter than fat bald lebanese mfs
So youâ€™re Israeli? I mean I donâ€™t mind as long as youâ€™re not a Zionist
What is a zionist exactly?
Someone who supports the killing of Palestinian people
Are you not familiar with the term? Itâ€™s a murderous term
Oh interesting, I only support avocado toasts
So where you from DANA?
Beirut!
Cool
So youâ€™re against whatâ€™s happening in Gaza?
Because if youâ€™re not, itâ€™s kind of a deal breaker for me
Are you aware that you have the most jewish name dana
Hahahahaha
Cool
Iâ€™m not Jewish, Iâ€™m atheist
Me too
Im against war in general
Thatâ€™s lovely to hear
A lot of people hate Arabs
And itâ€™s unfair because I mean, look at me, Iâ€™m arab and Iâ€™m a pretty little girl ðŸ¤—
Why do you think people hate arabs?
Most Arab cultures are sexist and homophobic
It stems from Islam
Shitty ass religion
The world has moved on yet Arabs still believe in ancient bullshit, itâ€™s why weâ€™re third world
all religion is trash
oh yes thats so true
Im not a fan of Arabs and I donâ€™t dare Arabs
But I donâ€™t believe that we should kill anyone
I have a question
Politically
Israel has enough intelligence to locate the head of Hizbullah
That rat Hassan Nasrullah
40 minutes ago
Why hasnâ€™t the Israeli army killed him yet?
We want him gone and only you can get rid of him
Thats a good ass question honestly
I dont think they know where he is
But how? You have huge intelligence
Backed by America
Perhaps lives in tunnels
America found bin Laden and saddam
And Israel is finding Hizb members and bombing them
How canâ€™t they find Hassan?
Or maybe they need him
to keep the weapon industry alive
wars = money
Thatâ€™s what I suspect
I feel like America needs his presence to keep the instability because itâ€™s what sells weapons
Exactly
Thatâ€™s sad though
I really want him dead
Everyone does
Except his dumbass followers
yeah you cant have peace in this world you need to sell weapons
who follows him?
If he dies and Hizb is demolished, Lebanese economy and tourism would flourish
Shiite Muslims
ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
So how is life in beirut you said?
Life is good, Beirut is a party city basically
Iâ€™m not a party girl but people have a lot of fun here
I stay home with my cats ðŸ¤—
I love staying home and watching a movie
You?
Im lying in bed with my cat right now
Nooo!!!ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
Thatâ€™s so cute
do you speak frensh in beirut
Yes
Show me your cato
We speak a third French a third Arabic a third English
wow thats awesome
parlez francais?

Oui! Mais je prefer lâ€™anglais, jâ€™enseigne lâ€™anglais en fait
ow they're twins
how cute
Yes!
that's why your english is so good
Haha I didnâ€™t study English at university though
I studied medicine
Iâ€™m actually a doctor
wtf
But I work as an English teacher
Because I hated medicine
did you finish it?
Like are you a doctor
30 minutes ago
Yes
How long was it
In 2022
7 years
I graduated at 25
What kind of doctor?
Thats insane
GP
7 years are general medicine
what is gp
I chose not to go into a residency program
General Physician
Where did you study
So Iâ€™m a general doctor, I didnâ€™t specify in a field
we have two American universities here, I studied at one of them because they gave me a 50% scholarship
Oh wow, what did you do for it?
(I got the scholarship because I ranked top 20 nationally in 2015 exams)
Are you some kind of wonder child?
In Lebanon, when youâ€™re in your last year of high school you do official government exams
I ranked #18 on a national level
For that year
Crazy
A few weeks later I got a call from one of the American universities offering a scholarship
I took it
Brains and beauty ðŸ˜˜ u might wanna get another passport and pass by Beirut sometime
So why are you not working as a doctor
It damaged my mental health
Hahaha if I get to beirut they shoot my ass
I got diagnosed with a mental disorder and it was ruining my life
Non-Israeli passport
Do u have an American or European passport? Nobody would know youâ€™re Israeli
From working as a doctor? what did you do
Yes
I got admitted for suicide twice
Yeah I'm actually russian or ukrainian or whatever
And I got held in a psych ward for a week
But without passport
:(
What did you do as a doctor that caused this
The stress I guess
Medical school is extremely stressful
Worst experience of my life
Lectures and exams constantly
No time to breathe
I was barely showering
Barely eating
I was cutting my arms and legs
Medicine ruined me
Thatâ€™s why I left it after I finished it
Now Iâ€™m much better
11 minutes ago
So you don't like to be choked then I guess ðŸ˜‚
Now thatâ€™s a different story ðŸ˜‚
They say mentally unstable girls are best in bef
I'm sorry to hear about that, you got scars?
Bed*
Are you mentally unstable?
Yeah theyâ€™re faint now but if u look close u can see them
Thats true
I want to see them
Sadly I qualify as mentally unstable based on my current diagnosis
But Iâ€™ve become so much better
Symptoms have decreased very much since I left medicine
So the government pays you for being qualified?

What made you better


Oh fuck
These are from my mental health account
On instagram?
A chill lifestyle of teaching English and not worrying about medicine anymore
Yes
I also went to therapy for a long time
Oh dam so you are real, until now I still thought you might be an undercover hizballa agent
HAHAHAHA
nah Iâ€™m as real as it gets
Im really sorry to hear about your trauma
But I love the scars, makes you unique
You really think so?ðŸ¥º
Thatâ€™s so sweet
My ex said theyâ€™re ugly
it shows that you had a hard past and overcame it
thats why he's an ex then
I wish u had a foreign passport ðŸ¥º
You would be able to come and we could hang out
We have plenty of nice beaches in the summer
Youâ€™d love it so much
And nobody would know youâ€™re Israeli, you could say youâ€™re European
Yeah I want to visit beirut it looks interesting
and feels exotic
It sucks that our countries are enemies, yâ€™all are so hot ðŸ˜­
Yes I look european
Men here are all short and bald af
unfortunately I only have this shitty israeli passport
ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜ž
You cant be arab you look french or slavic
Yes was your ex a bald fat mf
No!! I donâ€™t date Lebanese!
He was American
We did long distance for 1.5 years
He visited like 6 times
How did you meet
He was touring in Lebanon in 2022
We met on tinder
Decided to meet up immediately
We barely texted
We met up at my place and it was gonna be a one night
Thats awesome
A few days later he texts me that he canâ€™t stop thinking about me
You live alone?
Yes with my cats
What is that room with 2 beds in your second pic
Thatâ€™s my parentsâ€™ place
Itâ€™s not in Beirut
My place is in Beirut
where were you born?
Beirut
I lived my whole life outside of Beirut
and your parents live in?
No they live outside of Beirut
I just was born there
When I turned 21 I moved to byblos
For medical school
Lived there for two years
Itâ€™s one of the oldest cities in the world
And itâ€™s beautiful
Then 2 years later I moved to Beirut to work at the hospital
I was gonna stay there until graduation
After grad I decided I wonâ€™t move out, I liked living alone
So Iâ€™ve been in Beirut for 4 years now
oh wow byblos is far
and it looks like akko
Itâ€™s an hour drive from Beirut
Thats awesome that you made it
I prefer beirut
Tell me about you
What did you study
What do you do
Whatâ€™s your type
Will we ever meet ðŸ¥º
well before that we can meet on instagram
add me @a_makeyev
Iâ€™d love to but if anybody finds out Iâ€™m following an Israeli person Iâ€™d be in trouble
We could chat without following eachother I guess
